# Heart-Attack-Prediction

Heart attack prediction is a AIML application in which we analyze various medical data to determine the likelihood of a person having a heart attack. This data includes age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain, pulse while resting, maximum pulse, blood flow rate before meals  and other medical factors that are known to be associated with heart attacks.

This application is particularly useful for early detection and prevention of heart attacks, as it can identify patients who are at high risk for heart disease and enable healthcare providers to intervene before a heart attack occurs. It can also help reduce healthcare costs by enabling providers to identify and treat heart disease earlier, when it is more manageable and less costly.

In Heart attack prediction we use AIML algorithms to train the dataset which consists of medical factors or records and the corresponding outcome will be whether the patient had a heart attack or not. These algorithms are then used to predict the probability of a heart attack in a new patient based on their medical data .This application can be very useful for early detection and prevention of heart attacks. This can potentially save many lives and reduce the overall healthcare burden.
